CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:20 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findsolver.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "solver", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "solver" with any
  of the following names:

    solverConfig.cmake
    solver-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "solver" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "solver_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "solver"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
