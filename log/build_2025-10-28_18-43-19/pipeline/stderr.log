[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:20 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findauto_buff.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "auto_buff", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "auto_buff" with
  any of the following names:

    auto_buffConfig.cmake
    auto_buff-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "auto_buff" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "auto_buff_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "auto_buff" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
